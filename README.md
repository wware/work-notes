Markdown repository for various projects
========================================

Markdown is a great little language for documentation. This is a base
repository for projects so documented. There is a great little
[markdown-to-html converter](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip) for
Python which can be used to build a little server with a small but
pleasant subset of the features of Github.
